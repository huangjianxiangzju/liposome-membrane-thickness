# liposome-membrane-thickness

# A simple script to read the lipid head bead of liposome and divide the beads into patches. 
# The average thickness of every patch is assigned to the B factor of the pdb structure.
# The membrane thickness can be colored by the membrane thickness by using the option of B factor.


# An interpolation may help greatly improve the detailed visualizations of the surface. And it is easy to implement the interpolation code. But now it is lacked.
